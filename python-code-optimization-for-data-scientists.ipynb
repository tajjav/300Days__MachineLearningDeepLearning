This means that each pandas DataFrame we use can take advantage of the efficient characteristics of NumPy arrays discussed in the previous article. We discussed broadcasting and how it allows the NumPy arrays to vectorize operations, so they are performed on all elements of an object at once. This allows us to efficiently perform calculations over entire arrays. Just like NumPy, pandas are designed to vectorize calculations so that they operate on entire datasets at once (not just on a row-by-row basis). Let's explore this concept with some examples.\n","\n","We'll continue to use the baseball_df DataFrame we have been using throughout the chapter.
